Next Steps:
Use React to improve the presentation of the 'Todo List'. Drag and rearrange items. Edit directly from index instead of show page.
Add a weather widget to allow users to plan their accordingly.
Add a countown timer widget to allow useres to see which tasks took longest to complete. (Or which ones they've been avoiding the longest)
